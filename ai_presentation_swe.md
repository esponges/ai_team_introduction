## Core AI Concepts for Developers

### Large Language Models (LLMs)
**Definition:**  
A type of AI trained to understand and generate human-like text based on vast amounts of data.  
**Analogy:** Think of it as an incredibly fast "autocomplete" on steroids — except it can write code, summarize docs, or debug issues.

---

### Context Window
**Definition:**  
The maximum amount of text (including your prompt and the model’s output) the model can "remember" in one go.  
**Analogy:** Like the whiteboard size in a meeting room — too small, and you can’t fit all the details at once.

---

### Temperature
**Definition:**  
A parameter that controls how "creative" the AI is.  
- Low = predictable, safe answers  
- High = more variety, possible creativity but also risk of nonsense  
**Analogy:** Like adding spice to a dish — a pinch for stability, more if you want unexpected flavors.

---

### System Prompt
**Definition:**  
Special instruction that sets the model’s role and style before the conversation starts.  
**Example:** “You are a senior frontend engineer who writes clean, commented code.”

---

### Prompt Chaining
**Definition:**  
Breaking a complex task into smaller AI prompts, feeding outputs from one step into the next.  
**Analogy:** Like passing work between teammates in a relay race.

---

---

## Agents vs. Workflows

### Workflow Approach
**Definition:**  
A predefined sequence of steps for the AI to follow, often with strict control.  
**Analogy:** Like a factory assembly line — each station has a fixed role.  

- Predictable and easier to debug  
- Lower cost and resource use  
- Best when steps are well-known

---

### Agent Approach
**Definition:**  
An AI that can decide its own next steps and call different tools autonomously.  
**Analogy:** Like a junior developer with initiative — they might find creative solutions, but you need to review their work.  

- More flexible and adaptable  
- Higher complexity and cost  
- Less predictable

---

### Example Scenarios

**Workflow Example:** Log Analysis Bot  

1. Extract error details from user input
2. Search logs
3. Summarize findings in a fixed format


**Agent Example:** Support Agent  
- Same initial steps, but can:  
  - Create tickets  
  - Notify teammates  
  - Run additional diagnostics  
  - Make follow-up decisions

---

### Decision Framework
- Use **Workflows** for predictable, controlled processes  
- Use **Agents** for open-ended problem-solving  
- Remember: More autonomy = more review needed

---

## Tool Use vs. MCPs (Model Context Protocol)

### Tool Use
**Definition:**  
Custom functions or APIs you connect to an AI model.  
**Example:** Call your internal database or deploy a service via a script.  
**Best for:** One-off integrations tied to your specific environment.

---

### MCPs
**Definition:**  
An open standard that lets AI tools connect to common services in a reusable way.  
**Analogy:** Like a universal power adapter for AI tools.  
**Example:** Browser automation, GitHub repo analysis, or console debugging.  
**Best for:** Reusable integrations that work across different models.

---

### Recommendation
- Start with **Tool Use** for specialized needs  
- Explore **MCPs** for portable, standard integrations

---

## IDEs and CLI Tools

### Examples
- **GitHub Copilot:** AI-powered code suggestions in IDEs.  
- **Cursor:** IDE with enhanced context awareness.  
- **Claude Code CLI:** Terminal-based AI coding.  
- **Ollama:** Run models locally for privacy.  

**Best Practices:**
- Provide relevant files as context  
- Don’t accept suggestions blindly  
- Use for boilerplate, not critical business logic

---

## Model Selection Strategy

### How to Choose
1. Match model strength to task complexity  
2. Use cost-efficient models for simple tasks  
3. Experiment with different models for learning

---

### Example Model Strengths (Publicly Available)
- **Claude:** Great for detailed reasoning and explanations  
- **GPT-4/4o:** Strong general purpose + strategy/planning  
- **Gemini:** Balanced for code and general tasks  
- **LLaMA, Mistral, etc.:** Open-source, self-hosted options

---

## Understanding Costs and Resources

**Token Economics:**  
- Every interaction costs tokens (words in/out)  
- More context = more cost  
- Agents often use far more tokens than workflows  

**Cost Tips:**  
- Only pass relevant files/snippets  
- Cache repeated instructions  
- Use simpler models for repetitive work

---

## Context Engineering Best Practices

**Do:**  
- Provide focused, relevant context  
- Include key docs or code only when needed  

**Don’t:**  
- Dump your entire codebase for a small bug  
- Ask vague, open-ended questions

---

### Embeddings
**Definition:**  
Numerical representations of text/code that let AI compare meaning and find similar items.  
**Analogy:** Like converting books into unique barcodes based on their content.  

**Used in:** Search, RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), semantic clustering.

---

## Fine-tuning vs. RAG vs. Simple Context

**Simple Context:**  
- Add needed details directly in the prompt  

**RAG:**  
- Store knowledge in a searchable database (vector DB)  
- AI retrieves only relevant pieces for each query  

**Fine-tuning:**  
- Train the model on custom examples  
- Expensive and harder to maintain

**Rule:** Start simple → RAG → Fine-tuning (only if truly necessary)

---

## Effective Prompting Strategies

**Structure:**  

Context: [What’s happening]
Goal: [What you want]
Constraints: [Any limits]
Question: [Direct request]

**Use Examples:**
- Show input/output examples when possible
- Use rules like .github/copilot-instructions.md, .cursorrulles, etc for general guidance
- Reference similar code patterns
- Provide positive and negative examples

**Be Specific:**
- "Write a React component" → "Write a React functional component with TypeScript that handles form validation"
- "Fix this bug" → "This function throws TypeError on null values, please add proper null checking"

---

## "Vibe Coding" – Risks and Uses

### Great For
- **Rapid prototyping** new ideas
- **Learning new frameworks** or libraries
- **Side projects** and experimentation
- **Unknown tools/languages** exploration

### Serious Risks ⚠️

**Code Quality Issues:**
- Unsustainable, hard-to-maintain code
- Bad practices and anti-patterns
- Outdated implementations that don't match current docs

**Knowledge Gaps:**
- Lack of understanding of the generated code
- Missing context about system integrations
- Over-reliance prevents skill development

**Technical Debt:**
- Solutions that work in isolation but don't integrate well
- Security vulnerabilities from copy-paste coding
- Performance issues from non-optimized solutions 
- Learning new frameworks  
- Rapid prototypes  

**Risks:**  
- Poor maintainability  
- Hidden technical debt  

**Safe Practice:**  
- Use for exploration, not production  
- Always review and test outputs

---

## Hallucinations and Fact-Checking

### Verification Strategies

**Always Double-Check:**
- Cross-reference with official documentation
- Google alternative solutions before accepting
- Test generated code in isolation first
- Understand what the code does before using it

**Red Flags - Extra Caution Needed:**
- Security-related implementations
- Performance-critical code
- Integration with existing systems
- Deprecated or outdated syntax warnings

### Validation Workflow
1. **Generate** solution with AI
2. **Review** code for obvious issues
3. **Research** unfamiliar patterns or approaches
4. **Test** in controlled environment
5. **Integrate** only after understanding

**Golden Rule:** Never blindly accept LLM outputs

---

## Evaluating (Testing) LLMs

**Why Evaluate?**  
- Ensure accuracy, reliability, and safety  
- Compare models objectively  

**Common Approaches:**  
1. **Benchmark Datasets:** Use public coding/problem datasets (e.g., HumanEval, MBPP)  
2. **Custom Test Suites:** Create prompts and expected outputs for your domain  
3. **Evals Frameworks:**  
   - [OpenAI Evals](https://github.com/openai/evals) – test prompts systematically  
   - [LangChain Benchmarks](https://docs.langchain.com) – measure RAG & agent performance  

**Tips:**  
- Test both quality and cost efficiency  
- Include real-world edge cases  
- Run evaluations regularly after model updates
