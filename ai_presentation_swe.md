## When to Use AI vs. Manual Coding

### The Strategic Decision Framework

**AI is Excellent For:**
- Retrieving details from **unstructured data**
- Rapid prototyping and exploration
- Learning unfamiliar libraries/frameworks
- Generating boilerplate and repetitive code
- Code explanation and documentation

**Manual Coding is Better For:**
- Working with **structured data** that can be parsed recursively
- Performance-critical implementations
- Complex business logic requiring deep understanding
- Security-sensitive code
- System architecture decisions

### Real-World Overkill Examples
❌ **Don't use AI when simpler solutions exist:**
- Using LLMs to parse JSON instead of `JSON.parse()`
- Building LLM tool calls when direct API requests suffice
- Creating AI agents for tasks a basic script can handle

### **Key Principle:** Start simple, scale complexity only when needed

---

## Agents vs. Workflows

### Definitions

**Workflow Approach:**
- Predefined sequence of steps
- Controlled and predictable
- Uses LLMs for specific tasks within the flow
- Lower complexity, token consumption, and cost
- Higher control over outputs

**Agent Approach:**
- Freedom to make decisions and adapt
- Can choose between multiple strategies
- Higher complexity, token consumption, and cost
- Less predictable but more flexible

### Real Examples from Our Work

**Workflow Example: Slack Support Assistant**
```
1. LLM extracts details from user message (structured query)
2. Query logs using extracted details
3. LLM analyzes logs with specific instructions
4. Return formatted response via Slack API
```

**Agent Example: Advanced Support Agent**
- Same initial flow BUT can decide to:
  - Trigger alerts
  - Contact team members
  - Create intake requests
  - Escalate issues
  - Take autonomous actions based on analysis

### Decision Framework
- **Use Workflows** for predictable, controlled processes
- **Use Agents** when you need autonomous decision-making
- **Remember:** Agents = Higher cost + Lower control

---

## Tool Use vs. MCPs (Model Context Protocol)

### Tool Use
- **What:** Custom functions you define for the LLM
- **When:** Specific to your application needs
- **Example:** Custom Slack API functions, internal database queries
- **Best for:** One-off solutions, proprietary systems

### MCPs
- **What:** Standardized way for models to connect to external systems
- **When:** Working with common services and tools
- **Example:** Browser automation, HTML canvas inspection, console debugging
- **Best for:** Reusable integrations across different models

### Recommendation
- Start with **Tool Use** for custom business logic
- Explore **MCPs** for standard integrations (GitHub, browsers, databases)

---

## IDEs and CLI Tools

### Currently Approved: GitHub Copilot ✅
**Proven Productivity Gains:**
- **Test writing:** 4 hours → 20 minutes (12x faster)
- **API endpoint translation (JS to Go):** 2 days → 2 hours (8x faster)  
- **Prototyping/PoCs:** 3-4 days → 1-2 hours (24-48x faster)

**Best Practices:**
- Use thoughtful file selection for context
- Don't accept suggestions blindly
- Leverage for boilerplate, not complex business logic

### Personal Exploration Options
- **Cursor:** Enhanced IDE experience with better context awareness
- **Claude Code:** CLI tool for agentic coding tasks
- **Ollama:** Local model running for privacy-sensitive work

### Currently Approved: Gemini in GCP ✅
- Available for GCP workload identity
- Good general-purpose model
- Use for analysis, planning, and code assistance

---

## Model Selection Strategy

### Our Recommendations

**Claude (Personal use)**
- **Best for:** Complex coding tasks, detailed explanations
- **Why:** Superior code quality and understanding
- **Use cases:** Architecture decisions, code reviews, complex debugging

**Gemini (Approved for work)**
- **Best for:** General development tasks, analysis
- **Use cases:** Code assistance, planning, integration work

**GPT Models (Limited access)**
- **Noted strengths:** Planning and strategy (especially o3)
- **Our experience:** Limited, but worth monitoring

### Selection Framework
1. **Start with approved tools** (Copilot, Gemini)
2. **Consider task complexity** - match model capabilities to problem
3. **Factor in cost** - don't use premium models for simple tasks
4. **Personal exploration** is fine for learning

---

## Understanding Costs and Resources

### Token Economics
- **Every AI interaction costs tokens**
- **More context = Higher costs**
- **Agent workflows = Significantly more expensive than simple completions**

### Cost Mindfulness Strategies
- Be selective with context (don't dump entire codebase)
- Use simpler models for routine tasks
- Cache contexts when possible
- Monitor usage patterns (even if RE team handles billing)

### On-Premise vs. Cloud
- **Cloud:** Easier setup, latest models, managed scaling
- **On-Premise:** Data privacy, predictable costs, network independence
- **Our setup:** Hybrid approach with approved cloud services

---

## Context Engineering Best Practices

### The Art of Selective Context

**Do:**
- ✅ Select relevant files for specific problems
- ✅ Provide focused, targeted context
- ✅ Ask clear, specific questions
- ✅ Hint at potential issues or solutions

**Don't:**
- ❌ Feed entire codebase for simple problems
- ❌ Include irrelevant files that add noise
- ❌ Ask vague questions without direction

### Context Strategies by Scenario

**Unknown/Greenfield Projects:**
- Broader context helpful for understanding patterns
- Include architecture docs, README files

**Specific Problem Solving:**
- Narrow context to affected components
- Include related test files and documentation

**Code Reviews:**
- Focus on changed files and their dependencies
- Include relevant style guides or conventions

### Vector Databases and RAG

**When RAG Makes Sense:**
- Large, searchable knowledge bases
- Frequent queries against documentation
- Team-wide knowledge sharing

**When Simple Context is Enough:**
- Small to medium codebases
- One-off questions
- Information fits in context window

**Remember:** Don't over-engineer - start simple!

---

## Fine-tuning vs. RAG vs. Simple Context

### Decision Hierarchy (Start Here → Escalate Only If Needed)

1. **Simple Context/Prompting** 
   - Try first for most scenarios
   - Often sufficient for development tasks

2. **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**
   - When knowledge base is large
   - Need selective, up-to-date information
   - Cost-effective for repeated queries

3. **Fine-tuning**
   - Only when RAG isn't sufficient
   - Requires significant resources
   - Consider: Do you really need this?

### Our Recommendation
- **Start with good prompting and context**
- **Consider RAG for large documentation/knowledge bases**
- **Avoid fine-tuning unless absolutely necessary**

---

## Effective Prompting Strategies

### Best Practices

**Structure Your Requests:**
```
Context: [What you're working on]
Goal: [What you want to achieve]  
Constraints: [Any limitations or requirements]
Question: [Specific ask]
```

**Use Examples:**
- Show input/output examples when possible
- Reference similar code patterns
- Provide positive and negative examples

**Be Specific:**
- "Write a React component" → "Write a React functional component with TypeScript that handles form validation"
- "Fix this bug" → "This function throws TypeError on null values, please add proper null checking"

### Prompt Engineering vs. Context Engineering

**Context Engineering:** What information you provide
**Prompt Engineering:** How you structure your requests

Both matter - good context with poor prompting wastes tokens and time.
