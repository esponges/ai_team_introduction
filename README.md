# AI Tools for Software Development â€“ Presentation Outcomes

**Purpose:**  
Introduce the SWE team to practical AI concepts and tools that can accelerate development while maintaining quality and core skills.

**Key Outcomes:**  
- **Awareness:** Team understands current AI tools (e.g., Copilot, Claude, Cursor) and where they fit in development workflows.  
- **Foundations:** Clarity on essential AI concepts (LLMs, context windows, prompt engineering, workflows vs. agents).  
- **Decision-Making:** Framework for choosing the right model, tool, or approach based on task complexity and cost.  
- **Best Practices:** Guidelines for safe, cost-effective AI use without eroding software fundamentals.  
- **Risk Management:** Strategies to identify and mitigate issues like hallucinations, technical debt, and over-reliance.

**Goal:**  
Enable the team to use AI as a **force multiplier**, not a replacement for engineering skill.

## How to Run the Practical Examples

To explore the practical examples provided in the `practical_examples` folder, follow these steps:

1. **Install Jupyter Notebooks**: Ensure you have Jupyter Notebooks installed in your environment. You can install it using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```

2. **Open the Notebooks in VS Code**: Use Visual Studio Code to open the `.ipynb` files in the `practical_examples` folder.

3. **Set Up Your Environment**: Follow this [guide](https://medium.com/@claudia.nikel/how-to-setup-a-jupyter-notebook-in-vs-code-w-virtual-env-kernels-install-packages-884cf643375e) to configure a virtual environment, set up kernels, and install necessary packages.

4. **Run the Cells**: Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to see the examples in action.

5. **Environment Variables**: You'll require API keys (anthropic defaulted) or other environment variables. Copy the provided `example.env` file to `.env` in the `practical_examples` folder and replace the placeholder values with your own credentials before running the notebooks.

These examples demonstrate the differences between workflows and agents, providing hands-on insights into their implementation and use cases.
