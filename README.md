# AI Tools for Software Development â€“ Presentation Outcomes

**Purpose:**  
Introduce the SWE team to practical AI concepts and tools that can accelerate development while maintaining quality and core skills.

**Key Outcomes:**  
- **Awareness:** Team understands current AI tools (e.g., Copilot, Claude, Cursor) and where they fit in development workflows.  
- **Foundations:** Clarity on essential AI concepts (LLMs, context windows, prompt engineering, workflows vs. agents).  
- **Decision-Making:** Framework for choosing the right model, tool, or approach based on task complexity and cost.  
- **Best Practices:** Guidelines for safe, cost-effective AI use without eroding software fundamentals.  
- **Risk Management:** Strategies to identify and mitigate issues like hallucinations, technical debt, and over-reliance.

**Goal:**  
Enable the team to use AI as a **force multiplier**, not a replacement for engineering skill.
