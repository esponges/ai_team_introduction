    "1. **Start Simple**: Begin with workflows for well-understood processes\n",
    "2. **Evolve to Agents**: When requirements become complex or unpredictable\n",
    "3. **Hybrid Approach**: Use workflows for stable components, agents for dynamic parts\n",
    "4. **Monitor Costs**: Agent flexibility comes at computational cost\n",
    "5. **Testing Strategy**: Agents require more sophisticated testing due to non-deterministic behavior\n",
