## Scenario 3: Legacy Code Modernization Plan

### The Situation
You've identified a legacy component or function that needs modernization. Use Copilot to create a comprehensive refactoring plan that saves hours of analysis.

### Steps

#### Step 1: Code Analysis
**Prompt Template:**
```
Analyze this legacy code:

[paste code snippet]

Current context:
- This code is used for: [purpose]
- Current pain points: [performance issues, maintainability, etc.]
- Technology constraints: [what we can/cannot change]

Create a modernization plan that includes:
1. Issues with current implementation
2. Proposed modern approach
3. Migration strategy (can it be done incrementally?)
4. Risk assessment
5. Testing strategy
6. Rollback plan
```

#### Step 2: Work Breakdown
**Prompt Template:**
```
Break the modernization plan into Jira stories:
1. Preparation tasks (tests, documentation)
2. Incremental refactoring steps
3. Migration tasks
4. Cleanup tasks
5. Include effort estimates and dependencies
```

#### Step 3: Execute One Refactoring Step
Implement one small refactoring following your plan.

### Example Analysis

**Legacy Function:**
```javascript
// Legacy user data processing
function processUserData(userData) {
    var result = {};
    if (userData && userData.name) {
        result.displayName = userData.name.first + ' ' + userData.name.last;
    }
    if (userData.email) {
        result.email = userData.email.toLowerCase();
    }
    // ... 50 more lines of similar processing
    return result;
}
```

**Modernization Plan:**
```markdown
## Legacy Code Analysis: User Data Processing

**Current Issues:**
- No type safety (JavaScript â†’ TypeScript)
- Monolithic function (violates SRP)
- No error handling
- Mutation of shared objects
- No input validation

**Proposed Approach:**
- Convert to TypeScript with proper interfaces
- Break into smaller, pure functions
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Use immutable data patterns
- Add input validation

**Migration Strategy:**
1. Add TypeScript types alongside existing code
2. Extract validation logic
3. Extract processing functions
4. Add error boundaries
5. Replace original function
6. Remove old code

**Risk Level:** Medium - function is widely used
**Rollback:** Feature flag to switch between old/new implementations
```
